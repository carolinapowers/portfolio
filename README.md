# Interactive Portfolio Experience

> A modern, interactive portfolio application built with React and TypeScript, showcasing my professional experience through real LinkedIn recommendations with powerful filtering, searching, and sorting capabilities.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This portfolio is a **work in progress** that began as a rapid prototype created in partnership with Claude Code and Cursor AI. As the developer, I've been systematically reviewing all co-authored code and refactoring it to meet my professional standards when time constraints during the initial creation didn't allow for optimal implementation.

### Current Status

- **Tests**: Being added iteratively with focus on React Testing Library best practices
- **Code Quality**: Ongoing refactoring to improve patterns, architecture, and maintainability
- **Design System**: Exploring a separate design system prototype that could potentially be integrated
- **AI Integration**: Investigating modern AI workflows and tooling for enhanced development productivity

This iterative approach reflects real-world development where initial prototypes are refined and enhanced over time, demonstrating both rapid prototyping skills and the discipline to improve code quality through careful review and refactoring.
